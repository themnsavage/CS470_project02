# CS470_project02

## Description:
In this project we created animations for [B-Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-b-tree-2/), [Red-Black Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-red-black-tree/), and [Van Emde Boas Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/van-emde-boas-tree-set-1-basics-and-construction/). The project uses [react](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) as the web framework and uses a react component called [react-d3-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-tree) for animating the tree data structures.
